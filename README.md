# Neural-Networks
This project builds an ANN model to classify data from "Alphabets_data.csv" into alphabet categories. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score, highlighting the impact of tuning.
